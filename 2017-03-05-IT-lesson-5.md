  <tr>
    <td>I learned by reading from the manual and copying the text and code into the fuzebox. The other strategy which I have been using in others lessons is the pilot and navigator method which involves someone, my classmate, being a pilot (typing out the code and fitting electronic components in) and me being the navigator (telling the pilot what to type and what components he needs to use). After a while, these roles were swapped round.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that me and my partner did not have enough time to use the electronic components. I need to work on speeding up my work rate.</td>

    <td>Next time I will use the LED components and I will speed up the way me and my partner work so that we can experiment more with new and different things.</td>
